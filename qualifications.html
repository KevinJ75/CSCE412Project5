                I am interested in software development especially in backend/database development and data analytics. 
                I believe that my past experience working on a small team last summer played a big part in this. 
            </p>
            <p class="interests" id="para2">
                This past summer I worked with an atmospheric sciences professor here at <span style="color: maroon;">Texas A&M University</span> to create a python program to read data and create analytical models. 
                <a href="https://atmo.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/logantim.html">Professor Logan</a> had around 11-12 <a href="https://atmo.tamu.edu/facilities-resources/lightning/index.html">sensors</a> in the Houston/Southeast Texas area which collected data pertaining to lightning strikes such as the time of the strike, the charge, and the altitude. Together on our team of 4, my colleague and I delegated work to 2 high school students. We began constructing the backend program which would read the collected data from csv files and transform it into various models using matplotlib. The code for these models was tested rigorously to confirm that they would be created correctly with various datasets. Once we had the main concept for the program finished, we handed full backend responsibility to the 2 high school students and commenced work on the frontend. We started with a blueprint of how our UI would eventually look like with various features. We created some buttons and a main display for the plots which took some time to integrate. We would call every 3-4 days or meet together with the professor to discuss what features needed to be added and any bug fixes that were to be made. In retrospect, the <a href="technicalprojs.html">Agile</a> development process would have been very helpful in getting feedback from atmospheric science students who were also going to use the program. The difficulty in that was that we were creating this program during the summer so it was harder to get in contact with people due to vacation.
            </p>
            <p class="interests" id="para3">
                I enjoyed working together with others to create a complete product from the ground up. We did not follow a formal development process that is common in industry today, but I am looking forward to learning the framework and methodology in order to create an intuitive program in Foundations of Software Engineering.
