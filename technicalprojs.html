            Over this past summer, I got to work on a small team project under an atmospheric sciences professor at 
            <span style="color: maroon;">TAMU</span>. We created a Python program to read data pertaining to 
            lightning strikes in the Houston area and then created analytical models for both professor and students
            to use in their research/papers. The UI for the program is shown above.

        <p class="figureSummary" id="blueprintText">
            This was our initial blueprint for the interface. There were some features that didn't end up making it and some that were revamped.

        <img src ="images/models.png" alt="models" class="models">
        <p class="figureSummary" id ="modelsText">
            These are some of the models we created using matplotlib  plus a special library called <a href="https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/">cartopy</a>. These were tedious to make but quite interesting.
